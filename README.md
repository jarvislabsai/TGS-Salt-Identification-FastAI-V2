# TGS-Salt-Identification-FastAI-V2

The code is part of a blog series,[part-1](https://www.jarvislabs.ai/blogs/tgs-salt) and [part-2](https://www.jarvislabs.ai/blogs/tgs-salt-model) which shows how to build an end to end pipeline for an image segmentation problem.

It builds a solution for TGS Salt Identification Challenge [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge) in Kaggle.

By following the blog, you would be able to rank in the top 4% of the Kaggle LB. The blogs have step by step explanation of the key concepts like

* DataBlocks,

* Transformations,

* Using **unet_learner**

* Building custom unet architecture based on **se_resnext50**

* Adding hypercolumns.

* Adding custom TTA.

* Doing K-Fold predictions.

* Creating a Kaggle submission file.

At the end of the blog, I have also added a few tricks which you can try to improve the solution further.
